Technical Requirment Documentation

----------###-----------

Day 2: Planning the Technical Foundation* is well-written and aligns with the objectives of the day. Here's why it's appropriate:  

### *Strengths:*
1. *Frontend Requirements:*  
   - Clearly mentions user-friendly design and essential pages (Home, Product Listing, Cart, Checkout).  
   - Addresses both mobile and desktop responsiveness, which is key for a marketplace.  

2. *Backend System:*  
   - Using Sanity CMS is a good choice for managing products, customers, and orders.  

3. *Third-Party Integrations:*  
   - Recognizing the need for payment gateways and shipment tracking via APIs shows understanding of critical marketplace features.  

4. *System Architecture Workflow:*  
   - Step-by-step explanation of how data flows between the frontend, backend, and APIs is accurate and demonstrates technical clarity.

  5. *API Requirements:*  
   - Specific endpoints for products, orders, and shipment tracking are well-identified and necessary for building a scalable marketplace.  

6. *Documentation:*  
   - Highlighting the importance of technical documentation, including architecture diagrams and API specifications, is on point for Day 2.  

### *Suggestions for Improvement:*
- Add a brief note about *user experience (UX)* and testing to make the foundation stronger. For example:
   - "Plan intuitive navigation and test early for smooth user experience."  
- Include a line about *collaboration with the team* to ensure the plan is refined with feedback.
